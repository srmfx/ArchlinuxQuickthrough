# ArchlinuxQuickthrough
This is a quickthrough for archlinux/linux troubleshooting

These were mainly annotations from back when I was studying archlinux on my own before I even joined University.
When I joined University, I kept using and learning archlinux at my own pace and I kept doing this so even after I finished uni.

Because of that, some of the stuff in here is very very old and I haven't had the time to double check everything is 101% correct. 
Some tools and commands described may cause permanent damage to your linux distro or system.
